# KillbotCommandSearch 0.1



KILLBOT LTD, command search scanner. 0.1

So this is command search scanner that I made a while ago out of fear I didn't want to share it but, today is the day I deliver it to you.


I was worred the keys were the same for other systems, so I didn't want to share it till now.

It is a vectorized search engine, for finding vulnerabilities.

I found 1304 vulnerabilities related to Chinese owned AWS proxies, and sortinging using pandas in my second version I will be updating soon so called 0.2, where I searched using.

f"iptables -A INPUT -s {aws_ip}"

I may be wrong, but I believe work around the iptables firewall and who knows what else, it also has had in the past messages bragging about communist party.

I will be updating this with a patch tomorrow, to all the things, I think that it's important for and also that these illegal command placed by unknown
attacker attach themselves to firewall interfaces I made, and custom firewalls.


The precentages are off, but the found values are not
